Aether Realm is a feature-packed interactive Android app that provides users with a variety of functionalities, including an AI-driven chatbot, image and text interaction, and a text-to-text transformation tool. The primary focus of the project is the **AI Chatbot**, which boasts a sleek, well-designed UI, offering users an intelligent and smooth conversational experience. The app is built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, with a focus on performance and a clean, modern design.

## Features

### **AI Chatbot**
- **User Interface**: The chatbot has a polished and user-friendly interface. The main focus of this app, the chatbot is designed to engage users with meaningful, context-aware conversations.
- **Functionality**: The chatbot is capable of answering queries and providing instant solutions. It’s designed to handle various types of conversations, offering users an intelligent companion for daily interactions.
- **Future Development**: The chatbot has great potential for further enhancements, including integration with **ML Kit** for better NLP (Natural Language Processing) and **AI-powered responses**. The user interface can also be further refined with custom animations and additional features.

### **Image and Text**
- **User Interface**: The UI for this feature is decent but hasn't been given much focus. It allows users to pair images with text for an interactive experience, providing a fun way to enhance creativity.
- **Functionality**: Users can combine images with custom text, creating a unique and personalized display. While the feature is functional, it’s more of a creative tool for free time.
- **Future Development**: The UI can be improved by adding more customization options for the user. Potential integrations with ML Kit for image recognition or automatic caption generation can be added.

### **Text-to-Text**
- **User Interface**: The UI for this feature is basic and was primarily created for learning purposes. The design is minimal and functional but lacks the polish of the other features.
- **Functionality**: The app converts text-based inputs into useful outputs. This includes transforming user-provided text into meaningful responses or information.
- **Future Development**: The UI will be revamped for better user experience, and more advanced features can be added. Integration with AI for smarter text processing is also a possibility.
